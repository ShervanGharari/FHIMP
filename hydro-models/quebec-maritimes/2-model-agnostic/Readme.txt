Introduction
------------
This directory automates the "model-agnostic" part of setting up
hydrological models, specifically, running `datatool`, `gistool`, and
`easymore` to extract necessary information to set up various hydrological
models. Below the detail of each workflow is explained:


Workflows
---------
    1. datatool (version v0.4.1): 
       https://www.github.com/kasra-keshavarz/datatool

       This workflow simply prepares meteorological datasets by subsetting
       geographical and temporal extents. 

    2. gistool (version v0.1.6):
       https://www.github.com/kasra-keshavarz/gistool

       This workflow simply prepares geospatial datasets, such as landcover
       and soil maps, for hydrological modelling purposes. Preparation is
       done by geographical (and if applicable, temporal) subsetting of the
       original datasets, as well as calculating zonal statistics for the
       geofabrics of interest.

    3. easymore (version v2.0.0):
       https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE

       This workflow calculates aerial average of meteorological datasets
       (in this setup, using the outputs of datatool) for computational
       elements of hydrological models. In the current setup, sub-basins
       are the targets.

    4. model-agnostic.sh (version v0.1.0-dev0 pre-release): under
       development

       Workflow to execute all mentioned workflows above in a hierarchical
       manner to minimize user interaction with the workflows themself.

    5. model-agnostic.json (version v0.1.0-dev0 pre-release): under
       development

       Global configuration file to execute model-agnostic workflows on
       Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRA)'s Graham HPC in an attempt
       to minimize user interactions with the workflows mentioned above.


Datasets
--------
    1. Regional Deterministic Reanalysis System (RDRS, v2.1 via datatool):

       * spatial extents: Alberta provincial boundaries extracted from
         MERIT-Basins dataset
       * temporal extents: 1980-01-01 13:00:00 UTC until
          2018-12-31 12:00:00 UTC
       * climate variables: precipitation, 1.5m air temperature, 10m wind
          speed, surface pressure, 1.5m specific humidity, shortwave
  	radiation and longwave radiation
 

    2. Landsat North American Land Change Monitoring System 2020 (NALCMS,
       v1, last accessed on September 21st, 2023, via gistool):

       * spatial extents: Alberta provincial boundaries extracted from
         MERIT-Basins dataset
       * temporal extents: annual landcover reported for 2020
       * landcover categories: 19 categories (for complete information,
          refer to gistool's documentation)


     3. USDA soil category map based on Soil Grids (v1 2017, last accessed
        on September 21st, 2023, via gistool):
   
        * spatial extents: Alberta provincial boundaries extracted from
          MERIT-Basins dataset
        * temporal extents: annual soil map reported for 2017
        * soil categories: refer to USDA manual or gistool's documentation

Instructions
------------
After modifying the "model-agnostic.json" configuration file, execute the
"agnostic orchestrator" by:

    foo@bar:~$ ./model-agnostic.sh model-agnostic.json
