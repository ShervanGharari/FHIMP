Introduction
------------

This directory contains scripts to 1) extract the boundaries of the
province of Alberta, Canada, from the MERIT-Basins dataset as the base
geofabric for hydrological modelling experiment and 2) implement necessary
sanity checks on the extracted geofabric to assure it is ready for
modelling practices.


Datasets
--------

  * Geospatial fabrics:
  
    1. MERIT-Basins (version v0.7/v1.0, minor bug fix for coastline
    pixels): https://www.reachhydro.org/home/params/merit-basins
       
       This datasets was used as the base geofabric for the modelling
       practices. The dataset was accessed on February 27th, 2023.

    2. Provinces/Territories, Cartographic Boundary File - 2016 Census
    (version 2016, last accessed on August 10th, 2023):
     https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb

       This dataset was used the source geometry for the boundaries of the
       province of AB.


   * Workflows:

     1. "pre-process_geofabric.ipynb"

        Containing scripts to subset layers 72 of the MERIT-Basins
	dataset for Alberta provincial boundaries

     2. "sanity-checks_geofabric.ipynb"

        Containing scripts to implement sanity checks on the extracted
	geofabric from the previous script

     3. hydrant (v0.1.0-dev0): https://github.com/kasra-keshavarz/hydrant

        Currently under development, this packages provides common
	functions for the analysis, manipulation, and sanity check of
	river and sub-basin geospatial fabrics within the context of
	hydrological modelling. It is worth noting that this package is
	used in the two scripts listed above
